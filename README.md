# Patient Management System
This project is a web-based Patient Management System built using PHP and MySQL. It allows users to manage patient and doctor records efficiently, including adding, updating, deleting, and viewing information about patients and doctors.

## Features
* List Patients: Displays all patients with their details, including weight (in kilograms and pounds) and height (in meters and feet/inches). Users can sort by first or last name in ascending or descending order.

* Add Patient: Allows the user to add a new patient. Ensures the OHIP number is unique and prompts the user to assign a doctor.

* Delete Patient: Provides a list of patients for selection and allows deletion with a confirmation step.

* Update Patient Weight: Lets the user update a patient's weight in either kilograms or pounds (stored as kilograms in the database).

* View Doctors: Displays all doctors, including those with and without patients. Also lists patients associated with each doctor.

* View Nurse Details: Displays a nurse's details, including the doctors they work for, the number of hours worked, and their supervisor.
